### Being a Good Steward

A watershed is an area of land drained by a waterbody like a stream, river, or lake. The water in these bodies is directly affected by what happens on the land within the watershed, even if the water is not visible from where you are. One landowner's actions can cause problems for both upstream and downstream neighbors, which is why understanding your connection to local waterways is so important. As conservationist Kristine Tompkins noted, "You can't protect a place unless you understand it. You can't know a place unless you love it."

 Whether you live in an urban area, a rural setting, or somewhere in between, your actions impact the health of nearby waterways. Every positive action, no matter how small, contributes to healthier streams and a more sustainable watershed for all.
