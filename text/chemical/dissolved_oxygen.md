### Description
Dissolved oxygen (DO) is the life-support that aquatic creatures need to breathe underwater, just like we need oxygen in the air. When DO levels drop too low in a stream, fish and other water-dwelling animals experience the underwater equivalent of suffocation. Various factors can deplete oxygen, including warm temperatures, excessive algae growth from nutrient pollution, decomposing organic pollutants, and drought conditions which reduce water volume and flow. The graph reports DO as percent saturation to normalize for temperature effects, since warm water naturally holds less oxygen than cold water.

### Interpretation
Consistently low saturation (below 80%) suggests pollution from organic waste, excessive nutrients, or other oxygen-demanding substances entering the stream. Extremely high saturation (above 130%) typically indicates excessive algae growth from nutrient pollution, which can cause dangerous daily oxygen swings as algae produce oxygen during the day but consume it at night. Look for patterns during different seasons and weather events - sudden drops may indicate pollution incidents, while gradual changes might reflect seasonal or land-use impacts within the watershed.
