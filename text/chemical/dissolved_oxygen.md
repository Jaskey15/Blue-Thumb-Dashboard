### Description
Dissolved oxygen (DO) is the life-support that aquatic creatures need to breathe underwater, just like we need oxygen in the air. When DO levels drop too low in a stream, fish and other water-dwelling animals experience the underwater equivalent of suffocation. Various factors can deplete oxygen, including warm temperatures, excessive algae growth from nutrient pollution, decomposing organic pollutants, and drought conditions which reduce water volume and flow. Both too little and too much oxygen signal problems â€” low DO often indicates pollution or habitat degradation, while abnormally high levels (typically from excessive algal growth due to nutrient pollution) can cause "gas bubble disease" in fish, similar to decompression sickness in human divers. As one of the first measurements to show disturbance, dissolved oxygen serves as a critical indicator of overall stream health.

### Analysis
Chemical data show the DO for this segment of Tenmile Creek to be just below normal (80-130%), with the median value in the high 60's. This may be attributed to the drought conditions that have persisted in SE Oklahoma over the last several summers. It will be important to monitor DO levels in the future to see if they return to normal levels (>80%).
