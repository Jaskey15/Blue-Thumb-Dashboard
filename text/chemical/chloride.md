### Description
Chloride is a naturally occurring ion in freshwater systems, but elevated concentrations — primarily from road salt application, wastewater discharges, and agricultural runoff — can harm stream ecosystems. Unlike nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, chloride doesn't break down over time, making it a persistent contaminant once introduced. As a conservative pollutant that moves easily through watersheds, chloride serves as an excellent indicator of human influence on stream systems.

### Analysis
Chloride concentrations above 250 mg/L can be toxic to sensitive aquatic species, impairing reproduction and survival of fish, amphibians, and aquatic insects. Most chloride measurements for this segment of Tenmile Creek fall between 10 - 20 mg/L. These values indicate minimal impact from potential chloride sources like road salt or wastewater, and are not at a level of concern.
