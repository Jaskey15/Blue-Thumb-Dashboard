### Description
Chloride is a naturally occurring ion in freshwater systems, but elevated concentrations from human activities can harm stream ecosystems. Potential sources include wastewater, oil and gas activities, and street de-icing operations. Road salt application during winter months are the predominant cause of elevated chloride levels in Oklahoma streams. Unlike nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, chloride doesn't break down over time, making it a persistent contaminant once introduced. Because chloride is chemically stable and doesn't degrade over time, it persists in water systems once introduced, making it a reliable tracer for human impacts. When chloride levels are elevated, it often signals that other types of pollution may also be present in the watershed.

### Interpretation
Reference values are rough guidelines only - normal chloride levels vary dramatically across Oklahoma, with natural concentrations increasing from east to west due to geological differences. Focus on identifying seasonal patterns: winter spikes may indicate road salt impacts, while summer increases often reflect lower stream flows that concentrate existing chloride rather than new pollution sources. Compare current levels to historical site data rather than statewide averages, as stream organisms adapt to local baseline conditions and moderate fluctuations may not immediately stress aquatic communities. Persistent elevation above typical site ranges may signal pollution from sewage systems, oil and gas production, or excessive de-icing practices.
