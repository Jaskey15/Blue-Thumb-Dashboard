### Description
Phosphorus is an essential nutrient in stream ecosystems that naturally occurs in small amounts from rock weathering and organic matter decomposition. Aquatic plants take in dissolved inorganic phosphorus and convert it to organic phosphorus as it becomes part of their tissues. Animals get the organic phosphorus they need by either eating aquatic plants, other animals, or decomposing plant and animal material. As plants and animals excrete wastes or die, the organic phosphorus they contain sinks to the bottom, where bacterial decomposition converts it back to inorganic phosphorus, both dissolved and attached to particles. This inorganic phosphorus gets back into the water column when the bottom is stirred up by animals, human activity, chemical interactions, or water currents, then it is taken up by plants and the cycle begins again.
In healthy streams, phosphorus is efficiently cycled between water, sediments, and living organisms. However, excess phosphorus — often from fertilizers, detergents, wastewater treatment plants, and animal waste — can trigger harmful algal blooms at concentrations as low as 0.05 mg/L. 

### Analysis
Water quality standards consider phosphorus levels below 0.05 mg/L as "normal," between 0.05 and 0.1 mg/L in the "caution" range, and above 0.1 mg/L in the "poor" range. While several historical measurements at Tenmile Creek fell into the caution and poor ranges, the majority of measurements since 2017 have remained within normal limits. Currently, phosphorus levels at Tenmile Creek do not pose a concern for stream health.
