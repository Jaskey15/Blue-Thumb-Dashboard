### Description
pH is a measure of how acidic or alkaline water is, measured on a scale from 0-14, with 7 being neutral. Acidity increases as the pH gets lower. The normal pH range for Oklahoma streams is between 6.5 and 9.0, creating a balanced environment where aquatic life can thrive. When pH values fall outside this range, they can stress or even kill fish and other organisms by affecting their metabolic processes and damaging their gills and skin. Because different aquatic species have varied pH tolerances, changes in pH can shift entire ecosystem compositions, making it an important indicator of stream health.

### Analysis
The median pH for this segment of Tenmile Creek is 6.5, which lies just within normal range. While it is not yet a concern, it will be important to continue monitoring the pH levels for this segment to make sure they don't fall any lower.
