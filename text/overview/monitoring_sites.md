### Monitoring sites

Since 1992, Blue Thumb's volunteer monitoring program has collected data from over 300 streams across Oklahoma. There are currently more than 100 streams being actively monitored by volunteers. If you notice a historical site near you that's no longer being monitored, this presents a great opportunity to bring it back online! Additionally, areas without any active or historic sites offer excellent opportunities to expand Blue Thumb's coverage.

This interactive map provides a visual snapshot of stream health statewide, helping identify both well-maintained waterways and those requiring attention. Markers use color coding to indicate current conditionsâ€”green shows healthy readings while yellow, orange, and red reflect increasing levels of concern. Select a parameter from the dropdown to view status based on the most recent collection event. For further investigation, click on the monitoring site to explore its complete historical dataset.
