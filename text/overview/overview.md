### Stream Health Monitoring

Stream health monitoring is a vital process that helps assess the ecological condition of our waterways. This dashboard visualizes stream health data collected by Blue Thumb - Oklahoma's volunteer stream monitoring program that empowers citizens to protect local water resources through data collection and education.

Stream health is assessed using three main components:

* Chemical Assessment - Key chemical parameters that affect aquatic life
* Biological Assessment - Fish and macroinvertebrate community data
* Physical Assessment - Characteristics of the stream habitat

Explore each tab to see detailed data and visualizations for these components.
