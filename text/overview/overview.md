### Stream Health Monitoring

Stream health monitoring is a vital process that helps assess the ecological condition of our waterways. This dashboard visualizes water quality data collected from Tenmile Creek by Blue Thumb - Oklahoma's volunteer stream monitoring program that empowers citizens to protect local water resources through education and data collection.

Stream health is assessed using three main components:

* Chemical Water Quality - Measures of dissolved oxygen, pH, nutrients, and other parameters
* Biological Assessment - Fish and macroinvertebrate community data
* Habitat Assessment - Physical characteristics of the stream environment

Explore each tab to see detailed data and visualizations for these components.
