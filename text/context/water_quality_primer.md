# Water Quality Reference Guide for Public Questions

## Key Concepts

**Watershed**: An area of land that drains to a specific point (stream, lake, pond). Everyone lives in a watershed, and activities on land impact water quality downstream.

**Nonpoint Source Pollution**: Pollution without a specific point of origin - comes from diffuse sources across the landscape (fertilizer runoff, sediment from land clearing, animal waste, etc.).

**Water Quality Standards**: Clean Water Act requires waters to be "fishable and swimmable" - clean enough for aquatic life to survive and safe for human recreation.

## Major Pollutants and Their Effects

### 1. Soil/Sediment
- **Most common pollutant in Oklahoma**
- Fills pools and spaces, destroys habitat
- Reduces water clarity, affects feeding and plant growth
- Carries other pollutants (phosphorus, pesticides, heavy metals)

### 2. Nutrients (Nitrogen & Phosphorus)
- **Sources**: Fertilizers, animal waste, pet waste, atmospheric deposition
- **Effects**: Stimulate excessive algae growth, reduce oxygen levels, cause unpleasant odors
- Can lead to fish kills when oxygen drops too low

### 3. Chloride
- **Natural levels**: Eastern OK <5 ppm, Western OK up to 1000 ppm
- **Pollution sources**: Oil production, road salt
- **Impact**: Sensitive species affected at 300-400 ppm

### 4. Chlorine
- **Always indicates pollution** (leaking water pipes, pool drainage, sewage)
- **Highly toxic**: Most fish die at <1 ppm
- Evaporates within hours

### 5. Animal Waste
- Contains nutrients and organic matter
- Bacteria consume oxygen rapidly when processing organic matter
- Greater oxygen depletion than equivalent inorganic fertilizer

### 6. Pesticides
- **Range**: Non-toxic to extremely toxic
- **General rule**: Insecticides most toxic, herbicides least toxic to aquatic life
- **Urban concern**: Chlorpyrifos-based products (flea/tick control), glyphosate (Roundup)
- Multiple pesticides together can be lethal even at sub-lethal individual levels

### 7. Other Toxic Chemicals
- **Sources**: Household cleaners, paints, solvents, motor fuels, metals
- **Entry routes**: Storm drains, spills, improper disposal
- Often detected by effects rather than specific identification

### 8. pH (Acidity)
- **Normal range**: 7-8.5 in unpolluted Oklahoma water
- **Low pH**: Usually acid rain (not serious in OK)
- **High pH**: Excessive algae growth
- **Importance**: Affects toxicity of metals, ammonia, pesticides

### 9. Temperature
- **Critical relationship**: Warmer water holds less oxygen
- **Oxygen levels**: 15 ppm at 32°F → 9 ppm at 68°F → 7 ppm at 95°F
- **Fish stress**: Below 6 ppm (sensitive species), below 5 ppm (common species)
- **Main cause**: Removal of streambank trees (can increase temp 10-15°F)

### 10. Exotic Species
- **Examples**: Common carp, zebra mussels, Asiatic clams
- Displace native species and reduce water quality

### 11. Hydromodification
- **Definition**: Human-caused changes to natural flow patterns
- **Urban impact**: Impervious surfaces increase runoff volume and velocity
- **Effects**: Strand fish, eliminate species requiring stable flows

### 12. Pathogens
- **Sources**: Human and animal waste, leaking sewage pipes
- **Concern**: Disease transmission through water contact

### 13. Toxic Algae
- **Types**: Blue-green algae, Dinoflagellates, Cryptomonads
- **Conditions**: Unpredictable toxin production
- **Risk**: Livestock deaths, fish kills, human nervous system effects

## Common Sources of Pollution

- **Agricultural**: Fertilizer runoff, animal waste, soil erosion from fields
- **Urban**: Storm water runoff, impervious surfaces, household chemicals
- **Residential**: Lawn fertilizers, pet waste, grass clippings in water
- **Industrial**: Heated water discharge, chemical spills
- **Infrastructure**: Leaking pipes, poorly functioning treatment plants

## Natural vs. Polluted Waters

**Unpolluted waters** have stable concentrations of substances that native organisms are adapted to over thousands of years.

**Pollution occurs** when human activities increase concentrations beyond what native organisms can tolerate.

## Streambank Erosion

**Causes**: 
- Crops too close to streams
- Unlimited cattle access
- Development encroachment
- Increased water flow from land use changes

**Solutions**:
- Maintain 50-foot buffer zones around streams
- Limit cattle access to streams
- Design storm systems for gradual water release
- Preserve riparian vegetation

## Key Messages for Public

1. **Everyone impacts water quality** - we all live in watersheds
2. **Prevention is key** - proper disposal, buffer zones, responsible land use
3. **Multiple stressors** - pollutants often work together to cause problems
4. **Seasonal factors** - summer heat reduces oxygen, making pollution more dangerous
5. **Local solutions** - many problems can be addressed through individual actions
