# Stream Health Chemical Testing Reference Guide

## Understanding Chemical Testing

Chemical monitoring provides instantaneous data about stream health at a specific location and moment in time. This data measures **potential stream health** and helps explain biological conditions (bugs and fish populations). Chemical testing is just one part of assessing overall stream health, though it's often the most expensive component.

### Why Regular Testing Matters

- **Monthly testing** provides more data points than quarterly testing
- **Minimum 1 year** of testing recommended to capture all seasons and temperature changes
- **Seasonal patterns** often emerge (e.g., higher nutrients during growing seasons, higher chloride in winter from road salt)
- **Rain events** are important to test during as they show what's washing off the land and entering the creek

## Key Chemical Parameters and Healthy Ranges

### Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
- **Critical threshold**: 3 mg/L and below significantly stress fish
- **Testing method**: Two-step process with creek-side sample fixing and lab analysis
- **Notes**: Essential for aquatic life survival

### Oxygen Saturation
- **Normal range**: 80-130%
- **Caution range**: 50-80% and 130-150%  
- **Poor range**: <50% and >150%
- **Important**: Changes with water temperature; extreme values indicate potential wide oxygen swings over 24 hours

### pH (Acidity/Alkalinity)
- **Normal range**: 6.5-9.0
- **Neutral**: 7.0 (below = acidic, above = basic)
- **Concern**: pH swings can make ammonia and heavy metals toxic to aquatic life

### Nitrogen Compounds

#### Nitrate
- **Exceptionally high**: >10 mg/L N
- **Source**: Often from agricultural runoff and fertilizers

#### Ammonia  
- **Exceptionally high**: >6 mg/L N
- **Toxicity**: Increases with higher pH levels

#### Soluble Nitrogen (Combined Nitrate, Nitrite, Ammonia)
- **Normal range**: <0.8 mg/L N
- **Caution range**: 0.8-1.5 mg/L N
- **Poor range**: >1.5 mg/L N

### Orthophosphate Phosphorous
- **Oklahoma Scenic Rivers standard**: <0.037 mg/L P (state regulation)
- **General creek ranges**:
  - Normal: <0.05 mg/L P
  - Caution: 0.05-0.1 mg/L P  
  - Poor: >0.1 mg/L P
- **Source**: Often from fertilizers, detergents, and sewage

### Chloride
- **Exceptionally high**: >440 mg/L Cl (continuous levels)
- **Geographic variation**: Naturally increases from east to west across Oklahoma
- **Seasonal patterns**: May increase in winter from road de-icing salt
- **Other sources**: Sewage contamination, petroleum extraction

## Testing Considerations

### When to Test
- **Regular schedule**: Monthly preferred, quarterly minimum
- **Weather events**: Test during rain/snow events unless lightning or icy roads present
- **Seasonal coverage**: All 12 months recommended for complete picture

### Rain Event Testing
Rain events are particularly valuable because they show:
- **Runoff effects**: What's washing off the land into the creek
- **Pollution sources**: Non-point source pollution entering the waterway
- **Dilution vs. concentration**: Some parameters may increase (pollution washing in) or decrease (dilution from rainwater)

### Data Interpretation
- **First year**: Establishes baseline and seasonal patterns
- **Subsequent years**: Allow for trend analysis and comparisons
- **Context matters**: Chemical data explains biological conditions but doesn't tell the complete story alone

## Public Health and Environmental Implications

Chemical testing helps identify:
- **Pollution sources**: Agricultural runoff, urban stormwater, sewage contamination
- **Ecosystem stress**: Conditions that may harm fish and aquatic insects
- **Water quality trends**: Improvement or degradation over time
- **Seasonal impacts**: How different times of year affect water quality

## Limitations to Remember

- **Snapshot in time**: Results only reflect conditions at the moment of testing
- **One piece of the puzzle**: Must be combined with biological monitoring for complete assessment
- **Natural variation**: Some parameters vary naturally across geographic regions
- **Weather dependent**: Conditions can change rapidly between testing events
