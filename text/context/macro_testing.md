Understanding Macroinvertebrate Collections for Stream Health
Macroinvertebrates are small, spineless aquatic organisms visible to the naked eye, such as insects, crustaceans, and worms. They are crucial indicators of stream health because their communities respond to environmental changes and habitat impacts. By studying their composition and density, we can assess water quality.

Why are Macroinvertebrates Sampled?
Macroinvertebrate collections are primarily used for stream assessment because:

Exposure to Water Quality: The flowing water community is consistently exposed to the average water quality of the stream.

Established Metrics: Analysis methods for stream macroinvertebrate communities are specifically designed for flowing water environments.

Extensive Database: Oklahoma has a large database on the pollution tolerance of lotic (flowing water) macroinvertebrate communities.

Sensitivity to Pollution: Organisms most sensitive to water quality degradation typically reside in flowing water.

Where are Macroinvertebrates Collected?
Macroinvertebrates require a substrate to attach to in flowing water (lotic) communities. The most common habitats sampled include:

Rocky Riffles: Areas where the streambed causes small waves and is composed of gravel or cobble (1-12 inches).
Streamside Vegetation: Fine root masses of riparian plants hanging in the water with suitable flow.
Woody Debris: Dead wood (with or without bark) in the stream with sufficient current.

When are Macroinvertebrates Collected?
Macroinvertebrate communities fluctuate throughout the year due to species emergence and hatching. To ensure comparable data, collections are made during specific "Index Periods":

Summer Index Period: June 1 to September 15.

Winter Index Period: January 1 to March 15.

Collecting outside these periods, especially in spring or fall, can lead to unstable or incomparable data due to life-cycle dynamics.

How are Samples Handled and Processed?
Collected samples are placed in 1-quart Mason jars, filled no more than three-quarters full with the sample, and preserved with 100% ethanol, ensuring at least 5 cm (2 inches) of free ethanol above the sample. Jars and lids are labeled with permanent ink and pencil, respectively, including information like stream name, site date, time, waterbody ID, legal description, county, type of sample, and sampler's initials.

Samples are then transferred to a Macroinvertebrate Sample Custodian along with a Chain of Custody (COC) form. For analysis, samples may be subsampled and picked to identify and enumerate approximately 100-150 organisms. This process involves rinsing the sample, spreading it in a gridded tray, and randomly selecting squares from which to pick invertebrates. The picked organisms are stored in scintillation vials with ethanol and sent to professional taxonomists for identification to the genus level when possible.

Key Terms:

Riffle: A shallow, turbulent section of a stream where water flows rapidly over rocks.
Streamside Vegetation: Aquatic plants or roots along the stream banks that provide habitat for invertebrates.
Woody Debris: Dead wood in the stream, such as logs and branches, that serves as a substrate.
Summer Index Period: The time of year (June 1 to September 15) when macroinvertebrate collections are most stable for comparison.
Winter Index Period: The time of year (January 1 to March 15) when macroinvertebrate collections are most stable for comparison.
Lotic: Refers to flowing water environments like streams and rivers.
Lentic: Refers to still water environments like lakes and ponds.
