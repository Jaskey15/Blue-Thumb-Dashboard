### Habitat Assessment

Stream habitats are assessed by examining the physical features that support aquatic life. A healthy stream offers diverse places for fish and other organisms to find shelter, food, and reproduce. The assessment looks at three main categories: micro-scale habitat (what's in the water), macro-scale habitat (how the stream channel is shaped), and riparian/bank structure (the land alongside the stream). Key features include instream cover (logs, rocks, and plants where organisms can hide), pool variability (different water depths), canopy cover (shade from trees), rocky riffles (areas of turbulent, oxygen-rich water), and bank stability (how well the streambanks resist erosion). These elements combine to create environments where diverse aquatic communities can thrive.

Stream habitats are rated from low to high quality based on eleven components. High-quality streams typically have stable banks with diverse vegetation, varied depths, moderate shade, and a mix of habitats like riffles, runs, and pools. The presence of woody debris, cobbles, and aquatic plants creates hiding places for fish and other organisms. A healthy riparian zone with trees, shrubs, and grasses along the banks filters pollutants, provides shade to maintain cooler water temperatures, and contributes food and organic matter to the stream ecosystem. Together, these elements support a healthy, balanced aquatic community.
