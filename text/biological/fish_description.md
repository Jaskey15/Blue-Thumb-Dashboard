### Description

Fish communities serve as excellent indicators of long-term stream health because they reflect both water quality and habitat conditions over extended periods. Fish collection for bioassessment involves sampling a 400-meter stream reach using standardized methods including seining (using mesh nets) and electroshocking (using specialized equipment that temporarily stuns fish without harming them). The collected specimens are identified to species level, counted, and analyzed using a modified Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). This index evaluates seven key metrics including species richness, presence of sensitive benthic species, number of sunfish and intolerant species, proportion of tolerant individuals, and proportion of specialized feeders like insectivorous cyprinids and lithophilic spawners. Each metric receives a score (1, 3, or 5) based on comparison to reference conditions from high-quality streams in the same ecoregion. By examining these biological indicators alongside chemical data and macroinvertebrate assessments, scientists can develop a comprehensive understanding of stream health.
