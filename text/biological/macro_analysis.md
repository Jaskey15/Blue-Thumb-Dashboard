### Analysis

Similar to the fish IBI scores, macroinvertebrate bioassessment scores are summed and compared to a high-quality reference stream in the region and given a biological condition ranging from severely impaired to non-impaired. The general trend for both the winter and summer monitoring seasons since 2012 are encouraging, with the most recent summer measurements (2022) reaching ‘non-impaired’ status - the highest possible rating! What makes this particularly encouraging is the increased presence of sensitive EPT species that quickly disappear when water quality declines. Winter samples, while showing slightly lower scores than summer collections, continue to show positive trends as well. These improvements suggest that ongoing conservation efforts are working, creating better habitat conditions that support a more diverse and sensitive aquatic community. As these tiny creatures serve as early indicators of stream health, their recovery bodes well for the entire ecosystem of Tenmile Creek.
