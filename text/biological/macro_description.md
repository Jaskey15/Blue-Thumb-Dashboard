### Description

Aquatic macroinvertebrates are small creatures such as bugs, snails, and worms that live in water, lack a backbone, and are visible to the naked eye. Macroinvertebrate collection provides a sensitive and reliable indicator of stream health that complements fish data while reflecting more recent environmental conditions. These collections occur during specific "index periods" of community stability — summer (July 1 to September 15) and winter (January 1 to March 15) — allowing for meaningful comparisons across sites and seasons. Analysis involves calculating six key metrics: taxa richness (total number of different species), Modified Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (measuring pollution tolerance), percent EPT (proportion of sensitive mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies), EPT Index (total number of EPT taxa), percent dominant two taxa (measure of community balance), and Shannon-Weaver Species Diversity Index (measuring evenness of distribution). Each metric receives a score (0, 2, 4, or 6) based on comparison to reference conditions from high-quality streams in the same ecoregion. This system effectively detects degradation caused by pollution, habitat alteration, or other environmental stressors before they become severe enough to impact fish communities.
