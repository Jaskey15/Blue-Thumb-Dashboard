### Description

Aquatic macroinvertebrates are small creatures such as bugs, snails, and worms that live in water, lack a backbone, and are visible to the naked eye. Macroinvertebrate collection provides a sensitive and reliable indicator of stream health that complements fish data while reflecting more recent environmental conditions. Blue Thumb collects samples during stable community periods in summer (July-September) and winter (January-March), allowing for meaningful comparisons across sites and seasons. Blue Thumb volunteers collect samples from various [habitat types](https://www.bluethumbok.com/physical-monitoring.html): rocky riffles, streamside vegetation, or woody debris. The collected organisms are analyzed using six metrics that measure community diversity, pollution tolerance, and the presence of sensitive species. Each metric receives a score (0, 2, 4, or 6), with higher scores indicating better conditions. The total bioassessment score reflects overall stream health by comparing a site to high-quality reference streams in the same [ecoregion](https://dmap-prod-oms-edc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ORD/Ecoregions/ok/ok_eco_lg.pdf). This method can detect degradation caused by pollution, habitat alteration, or other environmental stressors before they become severe enough to impact fish communities.
