Title: PARTICIPATE IN STREAM RESTORATION

Why this is important: Community-based restoration efforts can significantly improve stream health by repairing damaged habitat and addressing pollution sources.

Tips:
- Join local watershed associations or conservation districts
- Volunteer for tree planting events along streams
- Help with invasive species removal projects
- Assist with bank stabilization and in-stream habitat improvements
