Title: CONTROL LIVESTOCK ACCESS TO STREAMS

Why this is important: Direct livestock access to streams causes bank erosion, sediment pollution, and bacterial contamination from waste.

Tips:
- Fence livestock out of streams and riparian areas
- Install off-stream watering systems
- Create designated crossing points if necessary
- Develop shade areas away from streams
