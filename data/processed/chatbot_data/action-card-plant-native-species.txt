Title: PLANT NATIVE SPECIES

Why this is important: Native plants have deep root systems that filter pollutants, prevent erosion, and provide habitat for beneficial organisms.

Tips:
- Choose plants native to your region
- Focus on perennials with deep root systems
- Group plants with similar water needs
- Reduce lawn area in favor of native plantings
