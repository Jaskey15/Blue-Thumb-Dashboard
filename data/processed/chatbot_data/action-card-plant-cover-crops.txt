Title: PLANT COVER CROPS

Why this is important: Cover crops protect bare soil from erosion, improve soil health, and filter pollutants in runoff during off-seasons.

Tips:
- Select appropriate species for your climate and soil
- Plant immediately after harvesting main crop
- Consider mixes of different cover crop types
- Properly terminate before planting next cash crop
