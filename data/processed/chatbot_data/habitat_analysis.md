### Description

Blue Thumb conducts habitat assessments using a modified EPA Rapid Bioassessment Protocol that examines three key categories: micro-scale habitat (substrate, cover, and flow), macro-scale habitat (channel morphology and sediment), and riparian/bank structure (vegetation and stability). During each assessment, trained personnel evaluate a 400-meter stream reach, taking measurements every 20 meters to capture the full range of habitat features. These assessments typically occur alongside fish collections, as habitat quality directly determines what fish species can survive in a given stream segment. Key parameters include instream cover (logs, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation), substrate composition (from silt to boulders), pool variability, canopy cover, rocky riffles, bank stability, and riparian vegetation width and condition.

### Interpretation
Habitat scores work like a school report card, with grades ranging from 0-100 and corresponding letter grades from A to F. Just as a student's report card reflects their performance across multiple subjects, habitat scores combine ratings from eleven different physical features to create an overall grade for stream health. Sites earning A grades represent excellent habitats with diverse, stable features that support thriving aquatic communities, while F grades indicate severely degraded conditions that can only support the most tolerant species. The grades between A and F represent a gradient of habitat quality, with each step down indicating increasing limitations and stress on aquatic life. When interpreting your local stream's "report card", look for connections between habitat grades and biological health. Streams with higher habitat scores typically support more diverse fish and macroinvertebrate communities.
