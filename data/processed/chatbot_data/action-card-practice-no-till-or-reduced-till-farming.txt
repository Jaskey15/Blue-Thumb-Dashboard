Title: PRACTICE NO-TILL OR REDUCED TILL FARMING

Why this is important: Tilling disrupts soil structure and increases erosion and runoff. No-till farming maintains soil health and reduces sedimentation in streams.

Tips:
- Leave crop residue on fields after harvest
- Use specialized equipment designed for no-till
- Manage weeds with careful crop rotation
- Consider cover crops between cash crops
