Title: USE DESIGNATED ACCESS POINTS

Why this is important: Entering streams at undesignated locations damages sensitive banks and vegetation, increasing erosion.

Tips:
- Look for established boat ramps and entry points
- Stay on designated paths to reach the water
- Avoid trampling streamside vegetation
- Report damaged access areas to local authorities
