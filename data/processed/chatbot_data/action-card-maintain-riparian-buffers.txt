Title: MAINTAIN RIPARIAN BUFFERS

Why this is important: Vegetated buffers filter pollutants, stabilize banks, provide wildlife habitat, and shade the stream.

Tips:
- Leave at least 30 feet of natural vegetation along streams
- Plant native trees and shrubs if buffer is degraded
- Avoid mowing, grazing, or farming in the buffer zone
- Control invasive species that might take over
