Why this is important: Chemicals poured down drains or onto the ground often end up in waterways, harming aquatic life and contaminating drinking water.

Tips:
- Use community hazardous waste collection events
- Never pour chemicals down drains or on ground
- Store chemicals in original containers
- Use eco-friendly alternatives when possible
