Title: PRACTICE RESPONSIBLE BOATING

Why this is important: Boat engines can leak fuel and oil, while boats moved between waterways can spread invasive species.

Tips:
- Maintain engines to prevent leaks and spills
- Clean boats thoroughly between waterways
- Dispose of waste properly, never in water
- Operate at no-wake speeds near shorelines
