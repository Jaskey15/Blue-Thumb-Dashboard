### Description

Fish communities serve as excellent indicators of long-term stream health because they reflect both water quality and habitat conditions over extended periods. Fish collections are made from Blue Thumb streams in summer, usually between June and October. Each creek has a fish collection every 4-5 years, following a rotating [ecoregion](https://dmap-prod-oms-edc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ORD/Ecoregions/ok/ok_eco_lg.pdf) plan. Fish collection involves sampling a 400-meter stream reach using seiningâ€”a method where mesh nets are manually pulled through the water to capture fish. The collected specimens are identified to species level, counted, and analyzed using a modified Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). This index evaluates seven key metrics including total species richness, presence of sensitive benthic species, number of sunfish and intolerant species, proportion of tolerant individuals, and proportion of specialized feeders like insectivorous cyprinids and lithophilic spawners. Each metric receives a score (1, 3, or 5) based on comparison to reference conditions from high-quality streams in the same [ecoregion](https://dmap-prod-oms-edc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ORD/Ecoregions/ok/ok_eco_lg.pdf), with scores summed to create a total IBI score and integrity class rating.
