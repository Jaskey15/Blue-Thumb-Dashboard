Title: PACK OUT TRASH

Why this is important: Litter in and near streams harms wildlife, degrades water quality, and diminishes recreational experiences.

Tips:
- Bring a bag for collecting your waste
- Pick up any trash you find, even if it isn't yours
- Secure items that might blow away
- Participate in organized stream cleanups
