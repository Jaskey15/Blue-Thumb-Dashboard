Title: MINIMIZE FERTILIZER USE

Why this is important: Excess fertilizers wash into streams causing algal blooms that deplete oxygen needed by fish and other aquatic life.

Tips:
- Test soil before applying fertilizer
- Use slow-release, phosphorus-free products
- Apply only the recommended amount
- Avoid application before rain
