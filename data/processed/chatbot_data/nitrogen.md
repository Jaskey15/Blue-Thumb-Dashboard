### Description
Nitrogen is an essential nutrient that exists in several forms, including nitrate, nitrite, and ammonia. While naturally present in small amounts, excessive nitrogen from human activities can severely disrupt stream health. Common sources include fertilizers, failing septic systems, animal waste applications, and soil erosion. When nitrogen levels become elevated, they trigger algal blooms that deplete oxygen during decomposition, creating harmful conditions for fish and aquatic life. Different nitrogen forms have varying impacts: ammonia can be directly toxic to aquatic organisms, while nitrate and nitrite primarily contribute to excessive plant growth. The graph shows all nitrogen forms combined as "soluble nitrogen" to assess overall nutrient balance.

### Interpretation
"Normal" nitrogen levels vary considerably across Oklahoma streams due to local geology, soil types, and natural conditions. The reference ranges shown provide general guidance, but your stream's baseline may be naturally higher or lower. Look for patterns in your data that deviate significantly from your site's typical range. Sudden spikes may indicate pollution events like fertilizer runoff or septic system failures, while gradual increases could suggest ongoing nutrient inputs. Compare seasonal trends to identify potential sources: winter elevations might point to failing infrastructure, while summer peaks could indicate agricultural or stormwater contributions.
