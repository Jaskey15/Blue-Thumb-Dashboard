### Description
Phosphorus is an essential nutrient that naturally occurs in small amounts in aquatic systems from rock weathering and organic matter decomposition. While typically present at low levels, excessive phosphorus—often from fertilizers, detergents, wastewater, and animal waste—can severely disrupt stream health. Phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient for plant growth, meaning even very small amounts can trigger harmful algal blooms that lead to low dissolved oxygen levels, taste and odor problems, and increased turbidity. Blue Thumb volunteers specifically measure orthophosphate-phosphorus, the inorganic form that is most readily available to plants and thus the most useful indicator of immediate potential problems with excessive algal growth.

### Interpretation
"Normal" phosphorus concentrations can vary between monitoring locations due to natural differences in geology and land use, so treat reference values as rough guidelines rather than definitive thresholds. When examining your data, focus on trends and patterns over time. Consistently elevated concentrations, seasonal spikes during growing seasons, or sudden increases may indicate pollution sources in your watershed. Look for correlations between high phosphorus readings and potential sources like agricultural activities, urban runoff, or wastewater discharge. If you notice persistent elevated levels or dramatic changes from your site's baseline, consider investigating recent activities in the surrounding watershed.
