Title: IMPLEMENT ROTATIONAL GRAZING

Why this is important: Overgrazing removes vegetation needed to filter runoff and prevent erosion, while rotational grazing allows recovery.

Tips:
- Divide pastures into smaller paddocks
- Move livestock regularly to prevent overgrazing
- Allow adequate rest periods for vegetation recovery
- Monitor forage height and adjust grazing accordingly
