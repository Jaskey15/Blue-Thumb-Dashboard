Title: ORGANIZE STREAM CLEANUPS

Why this is important: Trash and debris in waterways harm wildlife, degrade water quality, and can cause blockages that lead to flooding.

Tips:
- Partner with local conservation groups
- Focus on high-traffic areas like parks and bridges
- Sort collected waste for proper recycling
- Document your findings to track improvements
