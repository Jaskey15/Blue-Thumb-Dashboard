Title: STAY ON ESTABLISHED TRAILS

Why this is important: Off-trail hiking near streams compacts soil, damages vegetation, and increases erosion and runoff.

Tips:
- Follow designated trails even if shortcuts tempt you
- Avoid creating new paths to water access points
- Stay back from undercut or unstable banks
- Cross streams only at established crossings
