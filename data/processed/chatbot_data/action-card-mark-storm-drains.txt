Title: MARK STORM DRAINS

Why this is important: Many people don't realize storm drains flow directly to waterways, often without treatment.

Tips:
- Contact local authorities about marking programs
- Use approved markers or stencils
- Distribute educational materials to neighbors
- Adopt storm drains in your neighborhood for monitoring
