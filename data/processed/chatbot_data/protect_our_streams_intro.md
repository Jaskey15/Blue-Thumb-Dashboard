### Being a Good Steward

Picture this: you're standing in your backyard, and rain begins to fall. That water doesn't just disappearâ€”it flows across your property, picks up whatever it encounters along the way, and eventually finds its way to a stream, river, or lake. You are always in a [watershed](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?layers=f0e4c906467a49379d87abba1816b871), and what happens on your land directly affects the water quality downstream, even if you can't see the water from where you stand.

According to conservationist Kristine Tompkins, "You can't protect a place unless you understand it. You can't know a place unless you love it." One landowner's actions can cause problems for both upstream and downstream neighbors, which is why understanding your connection to local waterways is so important. Maybe it's the fertilizer you apply to your lawn, the oil that drips from your car onto the driveway, or how close you mow to the [riparian area](https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/water-quality-series-riparian-forest-buffers.html#riparian-areas-in-oklahoma). These seemingly small actions ripple through the watershed, affecting not just your immediate neighbors, but everyone living downstream. 

The beautiful thing about being a watershed steward is that every positive action, no matter how small, contributes to healthier streams and a more sustainable environment for all. Whether you live in town or in the country, your stewardship choices matter. After all, we're all upstream of someone.
