Title: SUPPORT WATER-FRIENDLY POLICIES

Why this is important: Local policies and ordinances can either protect or harm stream health on a community-wide scale.

Tips:
- Advocate for riparian buffer requirements
- Support limits on impervious surfaces in developments
- Attend public meetings about water resource decisions
- Encourage green infrastructure in community planning
