Title: REDUCE IMPERVIOUS SURFACES

Why this is important: Hard surfaces like concrete and asphalt prevent water from soaking into the ground, increasing runoff that carries pollutants to streams.

Tips:
- Use permeable pavers for patios and walkways
- Consider a permeable driveway material when replacing
- Disconnect downspouts from storm drains
- Direct runoff to vegetated areas
