Title: CAMP RESPONSIBLY NEAR WATERWAYS

Why this is important: Poor camping practices can damage riparian areas, introduce pollutants, and disturb sensitive wildlife habitat.

Tips:
- Camp at least 200 feet from the water's edge
- Use established campsites when available
- Use biodegradable soaps for washing
- Dispose of human waste properly using pit toilets or by burying it at least 200 feet from water
