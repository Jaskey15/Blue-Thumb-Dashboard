Title: CREATE RAIN GARDENS

Why this is important: Rain gardens capture and filter runoff from roofs and driveways, preventing pollutants from reaching waterways.

Tips:
- Place in a natural depression or low area
- Use native plants with deep roots
- Size garden to handle your roof/driveway runoff
- Include a variety of plant types and heights
